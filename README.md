# Forecasting Project with Deep Learning and SVR

This repository contains the final project for forecasting utilizing deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), using the Bali dataset spanning from 2015 to 2022 (Bali_2015-2022.csv).

## Dataset Splitting Scenarios
The dataset is split into three scenarios for training and testing:
- 80% Train - 20% Test
- 70% Train - 30% Test
- 60% Train - 40% Test

## Recapitulation Table
A recapitulation table is provided to summarize the forecasting results and analysis. This includes:
- Graphs and prediction results (Training, Testing, loss)
- Forecast Evaluation (MSE, MAPE, MAE)
- Conclusion and analysis of the final project results

## Forecasting for Next 12 Periods
A forecast is generated for the next 12 periods for the variable `total_visitor`, utilizing `total_accomodation` as a factor influencing the forecast.

Feel free to explore the project and the detailed analysis provided in the repository!
